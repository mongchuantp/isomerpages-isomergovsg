Launching a site on Isomer is fairly straightforward. Here we outline the overall process from the start till site launch.

### Site set up

When you're ready to get onboard:
1. Create an account on [Github](https://www.github.com) 
2. Send us request through [this contact form](https://go.gov.sg/isomer-contact/).
3. We'll create an empty template for you and grant you access to start editing

You can refer to our guide [here](https://v2.isomer.gov.sg/tutorial/firstedit/github-setup/) on how to create a Github account.

### Site editing

Once you've gotten access to your site on Isomer, you can start referring to the tutorial pages and start making your first edit. 
Subjected to availability of the Isomer team, we may conduct individual or combined trainings with multiple agencies. 

Once you've gotten a hang of how to publish your content on Isomer, you'll start populating your content or migrating your content from your old site to Isomer.

### Site launch

Before your launch your site, do let us know in advance (at least 2 weeks) so that we can free up time on the launch day itself, or if you could let us know before you've onboarded would be great too. 

Next, the following things would happen:
1. We'll generate a CSR for your to purchase your own SSL cert and provide your CNAME and A-record for you to update your DNS records on the domain you've purchased.
2. Send Isomer your SSL cert and we'll install in on our CDN
3. Make the necessary updates on your DNS records 
4. Isomer team will update our CDN and in 10-15 mins, your site will be live!
