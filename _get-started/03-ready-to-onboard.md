This entire process could take from 36 hours to 6 months, depending on the size of your site and your own internal process. 

### Setting up your site

When you're ready to get onboard:
1. Create an account on [Github](https://www.github.com) 
2. Send us request through [this contact form](https://go.gov.sg/isomer-contact/).
3. We'll create an empty template for you and grant you access to start editing

You can refer to our guide [here](https://v2.isomer.gov.sg/tutorial/firstedit/github-setup/) on how to create a Github account.

### Editing your site

Once you've gotten access to your site on Isomer, you can start referring to the [tutorial](https://v2.isomer.gov.sg/tutorial/intro/) and start making your first edit. Subjected to availability of the Isomer team, we may conduct individual or combined trainings with multiple agencies. 

Once you've gotten a hang of how to publish your content on Isomer, you'll start populating your content or migrating your content from your old site to Isomer.

### Site launch

Let us know in advance (ideally 2 weeks) prior to when you'd like to launch the site. If you need the site to be up urgently, let us know when we're onboarding you onto isomer. 

1. We'll generate a CSR for your to purchase your own SSL cert and provide your CNAME and A-record for you to update your DNS records on the domain you've purchased.
2. Send Isomer your SSL cert and we'll install in on our CDN
3. Make the necessary updates on your DNS records 
4. Isomer team will update our CDN and in 10-15 mins, your site will be live!
